# shareStuff_cs2102
A cs2102(intro to database project) use bitnami to create a simple web app

How to make bitnami work :(

1)Copy all the file in htdoc(shareStuff) and replace the all files in your htdoc(bitnami) folder

2)Open up dbconnect.php

3)Modify username, password and dbname and make sure they match with your local db configuration

4)Run Create-table.php to initiate all the table

5)Create a new php file and modify index.php to add link to that new file etc

6)put the new php files you have created and edited index.php back to htdoc(shareStuff) and pust back to git .:)
